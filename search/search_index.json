When you encounter this situation, you can use the Call attribute to annotate a class and specify which method should be called after the object is created using the constructor. Without annotation Given the following simplified example: class Value { public function get(): string { return 'Value'; } } class Model { public ?Value $value = null; public function setValue(Value $value): void { $this->value = $value; } } Without Wire 's help, you need to create a Model instance, and then call the setValue method, passing a Value object as an argument. $model = new Model(); $model->setValue(new Value()); assert($model->value->get() === 'Value'); Annotated with the Call attribute If you create an object using the creator and the class is annotated with one or more Call attributes, autowiring will automatically invoke any method specified in the attribute(s) as the first argument. use Conia\\Wire\\Call; use Conia\\Wire\\Wire; class Value { public function get(): string { return 'Autowired Value'; } } #[Call('setValue')] class Model { public ?Value $value = null; public function setValue(Value $value): void { $this->value = $value; } } $creator = Wire::creator(); $model = $creator->create(Model::class); assert($model->value->get() === 'Autowired Value'); Multiple method calls As mentioned before, you can annotate a class with multiple Call attributes.

Dependencies that require objects to be instances of abstract types, such as interfaces or abstract classes, are not supported either. These are obviously huge limitations. But there is a solution: The creator and all resolvers can be initialized with a container that is compatible with PSR-11. It is used internally to resolve arguments that cannot be determined otherwise. Entries in the container are prioritized. This means that autowiring will only be used to inject dependencies if the type of a parameter is not already registered in the container. Do not refuse to use the container Only in the simplest cases is a container not necessary. If only one of your dependencies requires a literal argument, you are doomed. Most of the time it is a good idea to combine Wire with a container implementation. Be warned about the simplified examples In the examples, we utilize a very basic container mock, which is also used in Wire 's test suite. More often than not, in the following code snippets, we store initialized objects in the container mock. We do this only to be able to show easy to understand code. Of course, you should utilize a fully fledged container implementation and leverage its functionality to retrieve values that cannot be resolved by Wire . The Problem In the following example, the resolver cannot autowire the Value class because it cannot determine the value for the constructor parameter $value , which is of type string : use Conia\\Wire\\Exception\\WireException; use Conia\\Wire\\Wire; class Value { public function __construct(protected string $str) { } } class Model { public function __construct(protected Value $value) { } } $creator = Wire::creator(); try { $creator->create(Model::class); } catch (WireException $e) { $message = $e->getMessage(); } finally { assert(str_contains($message, 'Parameter not resolvable')); } Solving the problem By adding the parameter type that was causing the issue to a container implementation that is compatible with PSR-11, and then initializing the creator with that container, the problem no longer exists. As shown in the code block below: use Conia\\Wire\\Tests\\Fixtures\\Container; use Conia\\Wire\\Wire; class Value { public function __construct(protected string $str) { } public function get(): string { return $this->str; } } class Model { public function __construct(protected Value $value) { } public function get(): string { return $this->value->get(); } } $container = new Container(); $container->add(Value::class, new Value('Model value')); $creator = Wire::creator($container); $model = $creator->create(Model::class); assert($model->get() === 'Model value'); Abstract types If there are abstract types like interfaces or abstract classes expected in the constructor of a class or its dependencies you will also need to work with a container: use Conia\\Wire\\Tests\\Fixtures\\Container; use Conia\\Wire\\Wire; interface ValueInterface { public function get(): string; } class Value implements ValueInterface { public function get(): string { return 'From Value'; } } class Model { public function __construct(public ValueInterface $value) { } } $container = new Container(); $container->add(ValueInterface::class, new Value()); $creator = Wire::creator($container); $model = $creator->create(Model::class); assert($model->value->get() === 'From Value'); Resolvers and containers Since the resolvers are the guts and the bones of the creator they work the same way: use Conia\\Wire\\Tests\\Fixtures\\Container; use Conia\\Wire\\Wire; class Value { public function __construct(protected string $str) { } public function get(): string { return $this->str; } } function readValue(Value $value): string { return $value->get(); } $container = new Container(); $container->add(Value::class, new Value('Model value')); $resolver = Wire::callableResolver($container); $args = $resolver->resolve('readValue'); assert(readValue(...$args) === 'Model value'); Note If don't want to use the Wire factory to create a resolver you have to pass the container via the Creator that is needed for all resolver constructors.

Since a Value object is required to initialize Model it is created beforehand and then passed to the constructor of Model . Value does not have constructor parameters and can therefore be instantiated safely. Technically, the creator uses reflection to determine the types of Model 's constructor parameters. If a parameter type is a class the creator will try to instantiate it by analyzing its constructor parameters as well. This process works recursively, continuously resolving arguments until they are all resolved, or until it encounters an unresolvable parameter. PSR-11 Containers When combined with a PSR-11 compatible dependency injection container, the creator can be assisted in resolving parameters that would otherwise be unresolvable. See PSR-11 Containers . Factory methods If a class uses a static factory method to create an instance, you can pass the name of the method to Creator::create : use Conia\\Wire\\Wire; class Value { public function get(): string { return 'Autowired Value'; } } class Model { public function __construct( public readonly Value $value, public readonly string $str ) { } public static function createModel( Value $value, string $str = 'default string' ): self { return new self($value, $str); } } $creator = Wire::creator(); $model = $creator->create(Model::class, constructor: 'createModel'); assert($model instanceof Model); assert($model->value->get() === 'Autowired Value'); assert($model->str === 'default string'); Parameters with default values If a parameter has a default value and is otherwise unresolvable, the default value is used: use Conia\\Wire\\Wire; class Model { public function __construct(public string $str = 'default value') { } } $creator = Wire::creator(); $model = $creator->create(Model::class); assert($model instanceof Model); assert($model->str === 'default value'); Assist the creator with arguments that are already available Predefined arguments If you already have some or all of the arguments available to you, you can pass them to the create method by using an associative array. Predefined arguments are matched by name. When the name of the parameter to be resolved is the same as a key in the associative array, the value of that key is passed as the argument. use Conia\\Wire\\Wire; class Value { public function get(): string { return 'Autowired Value'; } } class Model { public function __construct( protected string $str, protected Value $value ) { } public function value(): string { return $this->value->get() .

This means that you can use it to override Wire 's default behavior, for example when you want to choose one of several alternatives or when there are literal arguments such as strings, numbers or arrays expected. Example Let's assume you have two different functions, each of which requires a Model object as input. But you want to ensure that one of the functions always receives a SubModel instance, which is a subclass of Model . The following example shows how to accomplish that: use Conia\\Wire\\Inject; use Conia\\Wire\\Wire; class Model { } class SubModel extends Model { } function expectsModel(Model $model): Model { return $model; } #[Inject(model: SubModel::class)] function alsoExpectsModel(Model $model): Model { return $model; } $resolver = Wire::callableResolver(); // `expectsModel` is not annotated. An object of the base class is created $args = $resolver->resolve('expectsModel'); $result = expectsModel(...$args); assert($result instanceof Model); // `alsoExpectsModel` is annotated. An object of the sub class is created $args = $resolver->resolve('alsoExpectsModel'); $result = alsoExpectsModel(...$args); assert($result instanceof SubModel); You can control the behavior of the function (in this case, alsoExpectsModel ) by annotating it with an Inject attribute. If the function is not annotated, the resolver would create an object of the base class Model because the type of the parameter $model is Model . How to use Simply add the Inject attribute to the callable or constructor that you want to control. Then, you pass a named argument with the same name as the parameter for which you want to provide an argument. In the example, the parameter name in question is $model . So you pass the identically named argument model with the value you want the callable's argument to have, or, if it's not a literal, with an identifier from which the value is derived ( see below for a detailed description ). The snippet below shows the relevant part of the example above, highlighting the identically named parameters: #[Inject ( model : SubModel :: class ) ] function alsoExpectsModel ( Model $ model ): Model { ... You may also add multiple arguments, and you have to only add those you want to control: #[Inject ( another : 13.73 , value : 13 ) ] function theCallable ( int $ value , Model $model , float $ another ): Model { How injected argument values are determined The resolvers behave differently depending on the type of value that you want to be injected. Especially when dealing with strings and arrays, they are treated in a specific manner.

Strings If the value is a string, like in the following example: #[Inject(param: 'container.id')] // or #[Inject(param: SubModel::class)] the resolver uses the following rules. If a container is available, see if it has an entry with and id matching te value of the string. If so, return it, if not continue with step 2.

Arrays If the value is a array, as shown here: #[Inject(param: ['number' => 13, 'str' => 'value'])] the resolver uses the following rules. If the array follows a specific format, it is examined and a corresponding value is generated based on its contents. If it does not have that specific format, continue with step 2.

These resolvers are used internally by the creator. Resolve callable arguments To create an associative array of callable arguments, create a CallableResolver instance using the Wire factory and pass the callable to the resolve method. You can then pass the arguments to the callable via the ... operator, for example. Functions use Conia\\Wire\\Wire; class Value { public string $str = 'value property'; } function readValue(Value $value): string { return $value->str; } $resolver = Wire::callableResolver(); $args = $resolver->resolve('readValue'); assert(readValue(...$args) === 'value property'); Closures use Conia\\Wire\\Wire; class Value { public string $str = 'value property'; } $closure = function (Value $value): string { return $value->str; }; $resolver = Wire::callableResolver(); $args = $resolver->resolve($closure); assert($closure(...$args) === 'value property'); Instance methods use Conia\\Wire\\Wire; class Value { public string $str = 'value property'; } class Model { public function readValue(Value $value): string { return $value->str; } } $model = new Model(); $resolver = Wire::callableResolver(); $args = $resolver->resolve([$model, 'readValue']); assert($model->readValue(...$args) === 'value property'); Static methods use Conia\\Wire\\Wire; class Value { public string $str = 'value property'; } class Model { public static function readValue(Value $value): string { return $value->str; } } $resolver = Wire::callableResolver(); $args = $resolver->resolve([Model::class, 'readValue']); assert(Model::readValue(...$args) === 'value property'); Resolve constructor arguments You simply pass the fully qualified class name to the resolve method of the ConstructorResolver instance created by the Wire factory: use Conia\\Wire\\Wire; class Value { public string $str = 'value property'; } class Model { public function __construct(public Value $value) { } } $resolver = Wire::constructorResolver(); $args = $resolver->resolve(Model::class); assert((new Model(...$args))->value->str === 'value property'); Factory methods If you have a class with a factory method you can use the callable resolver as shown in the static methods example. Assist resolvers with arguments that are already available If you have some of the necessary arguments already at hand, you can pass them converted to an associative array to the resolve method's predefinedArgs and/or predefinedTypes parameters. The array's keys must match the names or types of the parameters of the callable to be resolved.
